# TW5-GitHub-Saver
This is an demo shows how to use Tiddlywiki 5.1.20+ for creating websites and homepages using GitHub Pages.

The new GitHub Saver feature in TW 5.1.20 allows to open a Tiddlywiki hosted on a GitHub repository, edit it online and save back directly to GitHub. This is similar to what is used on Tiddlyspot a dedicated Tiddlywiki hosting service.
